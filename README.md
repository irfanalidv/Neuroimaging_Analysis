#Neuroimaging Analysis via PCA using Apache Spark

Abstract :

Identifying patterns of brain activity in larval zebrafish and to study how the brain learns and controls behavior.Working with Time-varying images (generated using a technique called light-sheet microscopy) that capture a zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern.Identifying regions of the brain that encode particular properties like a temporal pattern and selectivity to a stimulus. Using PCA to identify distinct patterns across the zebrafish brain that are induced by different types of stimuli.

Associated Tasks : PCA projection, 2D representation of 3D data, Pixel intensity, Normalized neuroscience data, feature-based aggregation followed by PCA.

Programming language | Platform : IPython | Jupyter Notebook
CodeNeuro Data Set : Ahrens Lab data repository || Light-sheet imaging

Result : Successfully identified regions of the brain that encode particular properties, e.g., a particular temporal pattern or selectivity to a stimulus.
